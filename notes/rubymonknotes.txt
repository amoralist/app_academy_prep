EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT
	'self' - returns object Ruby currently identifies as 'you'
		defaults to 'main'
	Methods - target_object.method #=> resulting_object
	CODE IN METHODS AFTER RETURN IS IGNORED, RETURN EXITS METHOD
						BE CAREFUL
	Method parameters (x, y, ..., z = 0) can be set to default values (like 
		zero for z)
	object.method - returns all methods invokable on provided object
	'.sort' - sorting method to organize output objects by numerical and 
		alphabetical order
	object.method("argument to a method") - ATAM gives method additional 
		required information. comma separate for multiple arguments
	'.length' - returns length of string object
	'.include?' - searches object for an argument enclosed in parentheses
	'.starts_with?' - determines if object starts with parentheses enclosed
		argument
	Methods ending in '?' returns boolean 
	'.index' - returns index value of parentheses enclosed argument
	'.split' - splits string at each instance of parentheses enclosed
		character; returns an array
	'.concat' - equivalent to "<<"
	'.sub' - replaces first instance of first parenthetical argument with
		second and returns revised string
	'.gsub' - replaces all instances like .sub
	'.join' - returns array as a string with each element followed by any
		character in following parenthetical expression
	'.map' - performs bracketed expression on each element of an array
	'.select' - searches an element for bracketed expression
	'.delete' - removes element matching bracketed expression from element
	'.delete_if' - removes elements matching bracketed expression from 
		object
	'.shift' - like .pop but removes and returns the FIRST value of an array
	"The splat operator works both ways - you can use it to convert arrays to
		parameter lists as easily as we just converted a parameter list to an
		array."
REGULAR EXPRESSION
	surrounded by / /, used to match patterns. /[]/, used to match any 
		contained character
	'.match' - used on a string, searches for x from y position, RegEx ends
		in period. (/x,y./)
